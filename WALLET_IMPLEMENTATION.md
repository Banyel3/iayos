## üîí Security & Validation

### **Frontend Validation**

- ‚úÖ Amount must be greater than 0
- ‚úÖ Amount must be a valid number

- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for invalid inputs

### **Backend Requirements (To Implement)**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è JWT authentication for all wallet endpoints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User can only access their own wallet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database transactions for atomic operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è KYC verification for withdrawals above threshold
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Webhook signature verification from PayMongo

## üì± Responsive Design

### **Mobile View (< 1024px)**

- Wallet card in main profile section
- Full-width modals with padding
- Quick amount buttons wrap on small screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes

### **Desktop View (‚â• 1024px)**

- Wallet card in left sidebar
- Centered modals with max-width
- All features accessible
- Better visual hierarchy

## üé® Design Features

### **Visual Feedback**

- Loading states ("Loading..." text)
- Processing states ("Processing..." button text)
- Disabled states (grayed out buttons)
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Smooth transitions

### **Color Scheme**

- Primary: Blue (#3B82F6) for actions

## üöÄ Next Steps (Backend Required)

### **Backend Endpoints to Implement**

1. **GET /api/accounts/wallet/balance**
   - Returns current user's accountBalance
   - Requires authentication

2. **POST /api/payments/create-deposit**
   - Creates PayMongo payment intent
   - Returns checkout URL
   - Saves transaction record

3. **POST /api/payments/request-withdrawal**
   - Validates balance and KYC
   - Creates payout request
   - Updates accountBalance
   - Returns new balance

4. **POST /api/payments/webhooks/paymongo**
   - Receives payment confirmations
   - Updates accountBalance on success
   - Creates notification for user

### **Database Changes**

```python
# Already exists in Accounts model:
accountBalance = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

# Need to create:
- Transaction model (for transaction history)
- Escrow model (for job payments)
- Notification updates (for payment events)
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### **Test as Client**

1. Create client account
2. Go to profile page
3. Verify wallet balance shows (‚Ç±0.00 initially)
4. Click "Add Funds"
5. Enter amount (e.g., ‚Ç±1,000)
6. Click "Continue to Payment"
7. Verify error handling (backend not implemented yet)

### **Test as Worker**

1. Create worker account
2. Go to profile page
3. Verify wallet balance shows (‚Ç±0.00 initially)
4. Click "Cash Out"
5. Try to withdraw (should fail with insufficient balance)
6. Verify validation works correctly

### **Test Edge Cases**

- ‚úÖ Invalid amounts (negative, 0, non-numeric)
- ‚úÖ Withdrawal exceeding balance
- ‚úÖ Modal close and reopen
- ‚úÖ Multiple quick clicks (processing state)
- ‚úÖ Cancel button functionality

## üéì For Software Engineering Defense

### **Demo Script**

1. **Show Worker Profile**
   - Point out wallet balance
   - Click "Cash Out" to show modal
   - Demonstrate quick amount buttons
   - Show validation (try withdrawing more than balance)

2. **Show Client Profile**
   - Point out wallet balance with "Add Funds"
   - Click "Add Funds" to show modal
   - Demonstrate quick amount selection
   - Explain PayMongo integration

3. **Explain Architecture**
   - Frontend: React/Next.js with TypeScript
   - State management with React hooks
   - Backend: Django REST API (to be implemented)
   - Payment Gateway: PayMongo Sandbox

4. **Highlight Features**
   - Real-time balance updates
   - User-friendly modals
   - Input validation
   - Responsive design
   - Professional UI/UX

### **Panel Questions - Prepared Answers**

**Q: "Why use a wallet system?"**
A: "Wallet system provides better UX - clients can load once and hire multiple workers. It also reduces payment gateway fees and gives us better control over escrow and disputes."

**Q: "How do you ensure security?"**
A: "We use JWT authentication, validate all inputs, and will implement KYC verification for withdrawals. PayMongo handles sensitive card data, we never store it."

**Q: "What about real money?"**
A: "Currently using PayMongo Sandbox for testing with fake transactions. To go live, we just switch to production API keys."
