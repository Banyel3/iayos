Add PayMongo test mode check to Card payment endpoint

The endpoint should only work when BOTH conditions are true:
1. TESTING=true (environment flag)
2. PayMongo is using TEST keys (sk_test_...)

This prevents trying to use Card payment with LIVE PayMongo keys,
which requires business verification and will fail.

Production config:
- TESTING=true 
- PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (LIVE keys)
- Result: Card payment should return 404

Local dev config:
- TESTING=true
- PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (TEST keys)  
- Result: Card payment works with test card 4343434343434345
