# Jobs App Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored job-related endpoints from the `accounts` app into a new dedicated `jobs` Django app. This improves code organization and follows Django best practices for separating concerns.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Created New Django App: `jobs`

```bash
python manage.py startapp jobs
```

**Location:** `apps/backend/src/jobs/`

**Files Created/Modified:**

- `jobs/models.py` - Re-exports JobPosting and JobPostingPhoto from accounts.models
- `jobs/schemas.py` - Job posting schemas (moved from accounts/job_schemas.py)
- `jobs/api.py` - All job-related API endpoints

#### 2. Jobs API Endpoints (`jobs/api.py`)

**New Router:** `/api/jobs/`

**Endpoints:**

1. `POST /api/jobs/create` - Create job posting (clients only)
2. `GET /api/jobs/my-jobs` - Get client's posted jobs
3. `GET /api/jobs/available` - Get available jobs for workers (city-sorted)
4. `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Get single job details

**Code Moved:** ~362 lines from `accounts/api.py`

#### 3. Updated Configuration Files

**`iayos_project/settings.py`:**

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'accounts',
    'adminpanel',
    'jobs',  # NEW
]
```

**`iayos_project/urls.py`:**

```python
from jobs.api import router as jobs_router

api.add_router("/jobs/", jobs_router)
```

#### 4. Cleaned Up Accounts App

**`accounts/api.py`:**

- Removed 4 job posting endpoints (lines 1062-1424)
- Removed import: `from .job_schemas import CreateJobPostingSchema, JobPostingResponseSchema`

**Note:** JobPosting and JobPostingPhoto models remain in `accounts/models.py` to avoid database migrations. The `jobs/models.py` re-exports them for API use.

### Frontend Changes

Updated API endpoint URLs in 3 files:

#### 1. `app/dashboard/home/page.tsx`

**Changed:**

```typescript
// Before
"http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/job-postings/available";

// After
"http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/available";
```

#### 2. `app/dashboard/myRequests/page.tsx`

**Changed:**

```typescript
// Before
"http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/job-postings/my-jobs";
"http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/job-postings/create";

// After
"http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/my-jobs";
"http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/create";
```

#### 3. `app/dashboard/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changed:**

```typescript
// Before
`http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/job-postings/${id}`
// After
`http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/${id}`;
```

## API Endpoint Changes

### Old Routes (accounts app)

- `POST /api/accounts/job-postings/create`
- `GET /api/accounts/job-postings/my-jobs`
- `GET /api/accounts/job-postings/available`
- `GET /api/accounts/job-postings/{job_id}`

### New Routes (jobs app)

- `POST /api/jobs/create`
- `GET /api/jobs/my-jobs`
- `GET /api/jobs/available`
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}`

## Database Impact

**No database migrations required!**

The JobPosting and JobPostingPhoto models remain in the accounts app's database tables. The jobs app simply re-exports these models, avoiding the need for complex database migrations that would be required to move the tables.

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Organization** - Job-related code is now in its own dedicated app
2. **Cleaner API Structure** - `/api/jobs/` is more intuitive than `/api/accounts/job-postings/`
3. **Separation of Concerns** - Accounts app focuses on user management, jobs app handles job postings
4. **Easier Maintenance** - Job features are isolated and easier to find/modify
5. **Django Best Practices** - Each app handles one domain of functionality

## Testing Checklist

âœ… Django configuration check passed (`python manage.py check`)

- [ ] Test create job posting (client)
- [ ] Test view my jobs (client)
- [ ] Test view available jobs (worker)
- [ ] Test view job details
- [ ] Test send proposal (worker)
- [ ] Verify city-based sorting still works
- [ ] Verify frontend pages load correctly

## Files Changed

### Backend (6 files)

1. `apps/backend/src/jobs/models.py` - Created (re-exports)
2. `apps/backend/src/jobs/schemas.py` - Created
3. `apps/backend/src/jobs/api.py` - Created
4. `apps/backend/src/iayos_project/settings.py` - Modified (added 'jobs')
5. `apps/backend/src/iayos_project/urls.py` - Modified (added router)
6. `apps/backend/src/accounts/api.py` - Modified (removed endpoints)

### Frontend (3 files)

1. `apps/frontend_web/app/dashboard/home/page.tsx` - Modified (URL change)
2. `apps/frontend_web/app/dashboard/myRequests/page.tsx` - Modified (2 URL changes)
3. `apps/frontend_web/app/dashboard/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Modified (URL change)

## Migration Notes

Since the models remain in the accounts app, existing data is preserved. Future new job-related models can be added to the jobs app and will require migrations.

If in the future you want to move the JobPosting models to the jobs app database tables, you would need to:

1. Create new models in jobs/models.py
2. Run `makemigrations` and `migrate` to create new tables
3. Write a data migration to copy data from accounts tables to jobs tables
4. Update all foreign key references in Conversation and Transaction models
5. Remove old models from accounts app

## Next Steps

1. Run backend server and test all endpoints
2. Run frontend and test all job-related features
3. Verify city-based sorting still works correctly
4. Test job posting creation flow
5. Test worker job browsing flow
