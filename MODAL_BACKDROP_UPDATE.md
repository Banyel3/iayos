**After:**

- Light gray background with 20% opacity (`bg-gray-900/20`)
- Backdrop blur effect (`backdrop-blur-sm`)
- Modal starts from top with padding (`items-start pt-8`)
- Separate backdrop div that can be clicked to close
- Added border to modal (`border border-gray-200`)

## üé® Visual Changes

### Background Overlay

- **Old:** Solid dark overlay making background barely visible
- **New:** Subtle light overlay with blur - matches other modals in the app

### Modal Positioning

- **Old:** Fixed center positioning (`max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`)
- **New:** Scrollable from top with bottom margin (`mb-8` for spacing)

### Click to Close

- **New:** Clicking the backdrop now closes the modal (UX improvement)
