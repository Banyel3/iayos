## Component Reusability

### Shared Components Used

- `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle` - Content containers
- `Button` - Actions
- `Input` - Search fields
- Lucide React Icons

### Common Patterns

```typescript
// Search Pattern
<div className="relative">
  <Search className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2 h-4 w-4 text-gray-400" />
  <Input placeholder="Search..." className="pl-10" />
</div>

// Status Badge Pattern
<span className={`px-2 py-1 text-xs font-medium rounded-full ${getStatusColor(status)}`}>
  {status.toUpperCase()}
</span>

// Filter Pattern
<select className="px-4 py-2 border rounded-md bg-white">
  <option value="all">All Items</option>
  {/* options */}
</select>
```
