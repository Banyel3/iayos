    "category": { "id": 1, "name": "Electrical" },
    "budget": "â‚±5,000.00",
    "location": "Quezon City",

    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "posted_at": "2 hours ago",
    "client": {
      "name": "John Doe",

      "avatar": "/path/to/image.jpg",

    }
  }
}
```

### Backend Endpoint Logic

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/accounts/job-postings/{job_id}`

**Features:**

1. Fetches job by ID with related data (category, client, profile)
2. Formats budget with peso sign and commas
3. Calculates "posted at" relative time
4. Returns comprehensive job data
5. Returns 404 if job not found
6. Authenticated access only

**Query Optimization:**

- Uses `select_related()` to avoid N+1 queries
- Joins: `categoryID`, `clientID__profileID__accountFK`
