# User Role-Based Admin Panel Fixes - UPDATED

## Issue Fixed

The Clients page was incorrectly showing worker-related fields instead of client-appropriate data.

---

## Changes Made to `/admin/users/clients/page.tsx`

### 1. **Interface Update**

**Before:**

```typescript
interface Client {
  // ... other fields
  averageRating: number; // ‚ùå Workers get rated, not clients
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
interface Client {
  // ... other fields
  activeJobs: number; // ‚úÖ Clients have active jobs they posted
}
```

---

### 2. **Table Columns - Changed from Worker-focused to Client-focused**

**Before (Worker-focused):**
| # | Name | Job Title | Ratings | Jobs Completed | Status | Action |
|---|------|-----------|---------|----------------|--------|--------|

**After v1 (Client-focused but had agency field):**
| # | Name | Email | Company | Location | Jobs Posted | Active Jobs | Total Spent | Status | Action |

**After v2 (Client-specific fields FINAL):**
| # | Name | Email | **Account Type** | Location | Jobs Posted | Active Jobs | Total Spent | Status | Action |

**Note:** Changed "Company" to "Account Type" because Company is only relevant for agencies, not individual clients.

### 3. **Field Mapping Changes**

| Old Field (Wrong)               | v1 Field (Better)                 | v2 Field (FINAL)                         | Reason                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Job Title** (showing company) | **Company**                       | **Account Type** (personal/business)     | Separates business vs personal clients        |
| **Ratings**                     | **Email**                         | **Email** (kept)                         | Clients don't get rated; workers do           |
| **Jobs Completed**              | **Jobs Posted** + **Active Jobs** | **Jobs Posted** + **Active Jobs** (kept) | Clients POST jobs, they don't complete them   |
| ‚ùå Missing                      | **Total Spent**                   | **Total Spent** (kept)                   | Important metric for client value             |
| ‚ùå Missing                      | **Location**                      | **Location** (kept)                      | Helps identify client geographic distribution |
| ‚ùå Missing                      | ‚ùå Missing                        | **Preferred Categories** (NEW)           | Track what services clients typically need    |

## Visual Comparison

### Table Display Evolution:

**v0 (Original - WRONG):**

```

**v1 (Fixed but had agency field):**

```
| 1 | Sarah Wilson | sarah.wilson@example.com | Wilson Enterprises | NY | 15 | 3 | $2,450 | Active |
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Better but "Company" field is agency-specific

**v2 (FINAL - Client-specific):**

```
| 1 | Sarah Wilson | sarah.wilson@example.com | [Personal üü£] | NY | 15 | 3 | $2,450 | Active |
