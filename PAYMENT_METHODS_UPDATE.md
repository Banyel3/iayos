# Payment Methods Update - Multiple Online Options

## Overview

Updated the 2-phase payment system to support multiple online payment methods beyond just the platform wallet, providing clients with more flexibility in how they pay for services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates (`TWO_PHASE_PAYMENT_SYSTEM.md`)

#### Expanded Payment Methods

**Phase 1 - Downpayment (50%):**

- ✅ Platform Wallet (instant, no fees)
- ✅ GCash (direct integration, 2% fee)
- ✅ Maya (formerly PayMaya, 2% fee)
- ✅ Credit/Debit Card (Visa, Mastercard, 3% fee)
- ✅ Bank Transfer (online banking, no fees)

**Phase 2 - Final Payment (50%):**

- All online methods above
- Cash payment (in-person)

#### Database Schema Updates

Added new fields to track payment methods:

```sql
ALTER TABLE job_requests ADD COLUMN downpayment_method VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE job_requests ADD COLUMN final_payment_method VARCHAR(20);
```

Updated transaction history:

```sql
ALTER TABLE payment_transactions ADD COLUMN payment_provider VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE payment_transactions ADD COLUMN external_transaction_id VARCHAR(100);
```

#### API Endpoint Updates

Updated request bodies to include:

- `payment_method`: Options include WALLET, GCASH, MAYA, CARD, BANK_TRANSFER, CASH
- `payment_details`: Object containing method-specific details (account numbers, tokens, etc.)
- `external_transaction_id`: Reference ID from external payment providers

### 2. Frontend Interface Updates (`myRequests/page.tsx`)

#### TypeScript Interface Changes

Extended `JobRequest` interface with payment tracking:

```typescript
interface JobRequest {
  // ... existing fields
  paymentStatus?: "PENDING" | "DOWNPAYMENT_PAID" | "FULLY_PAID";
  downpaymentMethod?: "WALLET" | "GCASH" | "MAYA" | "CARD" | "BANK_TRANSFER";
  finalPaymentMethod?:
    | "WALLET"
    | "GCASH"
    | "MAYA"
    | "CARD"
    | "BANK_TRANSFER"
    | "CASH";
  downpaymentAmount?: string;
  finalPaymentAmount?: string;
  totalAmount?: string;
}
```

#### Mock Data Updates

Added payment information to all mock job requests:

**Active Job Example:**

```typescript
{
  id: "1",
  title: "Car Aircon Repair",
  price: "₱420",
  status: "ACTIVE",
  paymentStatus: "DOWNPAYMENT_PAID",
  downpaymentMethod: "GCASH",
  downpaymentAmount: "₱210",
  totalAmount: "₱420",
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Completed Job Examples:**

```typescript
// Example 1: Online payment (Maya)
{
  paymentStatus: "FULLY_PAID",
  downpaymentMethod: "WALLET",
  finalPaymentMethod: "MAYA",
  downpaymentAmount: "₱425",
  finalPaymentAmount: "₱425",
  totalAmount: "₱850"
}

// Example 2: Cash payment
{
  paymentStatus: "FULLY_PAID",
  downpaymentMethod: "GCASH",
  finalPaymentMethod: "CASH",
  downpaymentAmount: "₱325",
  finalPaymentAmount: "₱325",
  totalAmount: "₱650"
}
```

#### New UI Component - Payment Information Card

};
```

## API Integration Notes

### When Integrating Real API Data

1. Map API response fields to interface:

   ```typescript
   {
     payment_status: "DOWNPAYMENT_PAID",
     downpayment_method: "GCASH",
     downpayment_amount: 210.00,
     final_payment_method: null, // if not paid yet
     final_payment_amount: null,
     total_amount: 420.00
   }
   ```

2. Format amounts with currency:

   ```typescript
   const formattedAmount = `₱${amount.toLocaleString()}`;
   ```

3. Handle missing data gracefully:

   ```typescript
   {selectedJob.paymentStatus && (
     // Only show if data exists
   )}
   ```

4. External transaction IDs:
   - Store GCash reference numbers
   - Store Maya transaction IDs
   - Store Stripe/PayMongo payment IDs
   - Display in detailed transaction view

**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** Frontend UI Complete, Backend Integration Pending  
**Next Steps:**

1. Backend payment gateway integration
