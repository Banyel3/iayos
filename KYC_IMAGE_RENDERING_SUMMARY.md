# KYC Image Rendering Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive image rendering functionality for KYC documents in the admin panel with proper error handling, loading states, and signed URL generation from Supabase.

---

## Frontend Changes (`apps/frontend_web/app/admin/kyc/pending/page.tsx`)

### ✅ **1. Image Rendering Component**

Created a reusable `KYCDocumentImage` component that:

- Displays KYC document images (Front ID, Back ID, Clearance, Selfie)
- Shows loading spinner while images are loading
- Handles image load errors gracefully with fallback UI
- Allows click-to-expand functionality (opens in new tab)
- Includes hover effects with Eye icon overlay
- Proper styling with borders, padding, and responsive grid layout

### ✅ **2. State Management**

Added new state variables:

```typescript
const [imageLoadingStates, setImageLoadingStates] = useState<
  Record<string, boolean>
>({});
const [imageErrors, setImageErrors] = useState<Record<string, boolean>>({});
```

- Tracks loading state per image individually
- Tracks error state for each image
- Enables proper UI feedback for each document

### ✅ **3. Image Display Features**

#### **Loading States:**

- Animated spinner shown while image is loading
- Image hidden until fully loaded
- Smooth transition when image appears

#### **Error Handling:**

- Fallback UI with file icon when image fails to load
- Clear error message: "Failed to load image"
- Maintains layout consistency even with errors

#### **Interactive Features:**

- Hover effect with semi-transparent overlay
- Eye icon appears on hover
- Click to open image in new tab
- Cursor changes to pointer on hover

#### **Empty State:**

- Shows message when no documents are available
- Clean, centered layout with icon
- Maintains visual consistency

### ✅ **4. Grid Layout**

- 2x2 grid layout for documents
- Responsive design with proper gaps
- Each document has:
  - Label (Front ID, Back ID, Clearance Document, Selfie with ID)
  - Image container (h-48 height)
  - Bordered card with gray background
  - Rounded corners for modern look

---

## Backend Changes

### ✅ **1. Service Layer (`apps/backend/src/adminpanel/service.py`)**

#### **Added `profileType` to Response:**

```python
profile_data = {
    p.accountFK.accountID: {
        "firstName": p.firstName,
        "lastName": p.lastName,
        "contactNum": p.contactNum,
        "birthDate": p.birthDate.isoformat() if p.birthDate else None,
        "profileImg": p.profileImg,
        "profileType": p.profileType,  # ✅ Added
    }
    for p in profiles
}
```

#### **Fixed `review_kyc_items` Function:**

```python
def review_kyc_items(request):
    # Extract file URLs from request
    front_id_link = request.data.get("frontIDLink")
    back_id_link = request.data.get("backIDLink")
    clearance_link = request.data.get("clearanceLink")
    selfie_link = request.data.get("selfieLink")

    # Create signed URLs only for files that exist
    urls = {}

    if front_id_link:
        result = settings.SUPABASE.storage.from_("kyc-docs").create_signed_url(
            front_id_link, expires_in=60 * 60
        )
        urls["frontIDLink"] = result.get("signedURL", "") if isinstance(result, dict) else result
    else:
        urls["frontIDLink"] = ""

    # Similar logic for backIDLink, clearanceLink, selfieLink...

    return urls
```

**Key Improvements:**

- ✅ Fixed Supabase client reference (`settings.SUPABASE` instead of `settings.supabase`)
- ✅ Handles empty URLs gracefully (returns empty string if no file)
- ✅ Proper signed URL extraction from Supabase response
- ✅ 1-hour expiration time for security
- ✅ Handles both dict response and direct URL response from Supabase

### ✅ **2. API Layer (`apps/backend/src/adminpanel/api.py`)**

#### **Fixed Review Endpoint:**

```python
@router.post("/kyc/review")
def review_kyc(request):  # ✅ Fixed: removed 'body' parameter
    try:
        return review_kyc_items(request)  # ✅ Fixed: passes request directly
    except Exception as e:
        return Response(status=500, content={"error": str(e)})
```

**Key Fix:**

- ✅ Corrected parameter passing from `review_kyc_items(body)` to `review_kyc_items(request)`
- Django Ninja automatically parses request body into `request.data`

## User Experience Flow

### **Step 1: View Pending KYC Submissions**

- Admin sees list of pending KYC submissions
- Each card shows user info, submission date, priority, document count

### **Step 2: Click "Review" Button**

- Button changes to "Loading..." with disabled state
- Frontend extracts file URLs from stored backend data
- Sends POST request to `/api/adminpanel/kyc/review`
- Backend generates signed URLs from Supabase (1-hour expiration)

### **Step 3: View Documents**

- Card expands to show document grid
- Each image shows loading spinner initially
- Images appear with smooth transition when loaded
- Error fallback shown if image fails to load

### **Step 4: Interact with Images**

- Hover over image to see Eye icon overlay
- Click image to open full-size in new tab
- Click "Hide Files" to collapse the section

### **Step 5: Take Action**

- Review documents in expanded view
- Click "Approve" or "Reject" buttons (to be implemented)
